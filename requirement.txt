I have a JSON file that I need some JavaScript Math functions applied.  I need MIN, MAX, AVERAGE and Number of objects (COUNT).  Just some code that I can put into a function  Something like

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53648919/get-min-and-max-of-nested-json-object

I can Google but I don't have time.

====================

I am creating a heatmap GIS project and this will create the data for the code

I will take the MIN and the MAX and divide it into 5 sections to determine the color to apply to the fillcolor of a leaflet.js project

 Just code 
 actually make just a line of code for each- 

 like var min = Math.min(...data.map(e => e.room.price))
console.log(min)
